In this project, I investigated whether there is a causal relationship between London's Opportunity Areas (zones intended to increase housing supply) and house prices. In order to do this, I used a regression discontinuity design to compare points just inside the boundary of opportunity areas to those just outside. 

It established that there does not appear to be a causal relationship between Opportunity Areas and increased house prices, which is a positive result for the efficacy of the policy.
